# Game of Thrones Trivia
## What it does
This app is a trivia game with a Game of Thrones theme. Upon pushing the play button, the game displays a question and responds to user input
by displaying a gif and text message. The game utilizes a single object that contains trivia "cards" which themselves contain: a question,
answers, an image for a right answer, an image for a wrong answer, and right answer and wrong answer messages. Through a combination of 
4 primary functions and 6 minor functions the game cycles through each object within the main trivia card "deck". 

## Purpose
The game's primary purpose is to utilize timers to dictate how the game's jquery affects objects on the DOM. Additionally the game is a 
practice in learning how to use and call nested objects, and how to create HTML elements dynamically.
